Description: Provides 'R6' objects to perform parallelized hyperparameter
    optimization and cross-validation. Hyperparameter optimization can be
    performed with Bayesian optimization (via 'ParBayesianOptimization'
    <https://cran.r-project.org/package=ParBayesianOptimization>) and grid
    search. The optimized hyperparameters can be validated using k-fold
    cross-validation. Alternatively, hyperparameter optimization and
    validation can be performed with nested cross-validation. While
    'mlexperiments' focuses on core wrappers for machine learning
    experiments, additional learner algorithms can be supplemented by
    inheriting from the provided learner base class.
